# Aliyah's Portfolio 

## A web portfolio that showcases past projects and contact information for Aliyah Musaliar. The webpage has a responsive design, meaning that when various elements are hovered over with the cursor (navigation options, banner button, project images, and contact information) the elements display transitional animations. 



As I do not have an extensive project portfolio as this is my first-time learning html/css beyond editing my tumblr-themes in middle school, I opted to showcase other projects/skills I have from past work experience. 

While building the website I had a lot of difficulty managing how certain elements would land on the page. Furthermore, it was difficult to try and keep track of all of the moving parts as I worked through css. 

Throughout completing this project I learned how to do various transitions (references in css), how to create color palletes (using coolors) and apply them to make a aesthetically-pleasing portfolio and synthesize past skills I had learned in previous classes to build html/css files from screatch. 

When pressing the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponsing section. 

When pressing the images on the "my work" section, the images will take users to off-site webpages.

When pressing the button on theh banner, it will also take the user to off-site webpages.
