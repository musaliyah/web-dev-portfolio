                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <div>
                      <p>
                        I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington, where I double majored in Socio-Legal studies (LSJ) and Ethics. Throughout all of my work I equipt the lens of abolitionism to promote accountability, accessibility and creativity. While abolitionism is often framed as just the breaking down of oppressive institutions, the framework also uplifts the building and growth of direct community care. Throughout all of my experiences I center imagination outside of the boundaries of capitalism, white-supremacy, settler-colonialism, casteism, imperialism and their accompanying opressive practices.<br>
                        
                        <br>In high-school I worked at Seattle's NPR-affiliate KUOW, where I produced award winning radio content for youth that uplifted concerns and hopes of queer and trans youth. In college, I worked in a queer tattoo-studio where I collaborated with clients to design tattoos that showcased the values and interests of QTBIPOC. I presently work as a survivor advocate, where I fight against the trope of a "good-survivor" to decriminalize Black and Brown survivors.<br>
